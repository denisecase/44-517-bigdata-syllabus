    <h2>Course Late Work Policy</h2>

    Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. 
    If you must miss a due date, 
    contact the instructor in advance or as early as possible. 
    Due dates get you ready for coming material. 
    Keeping up is critical. 
    On rare occasions, 
    special challenges or obligations may make it difficult to submit on time. 
    You typically have a one-week grace period 
    where the work may still be submitted and graded. 
    Late penalties will be described in the rubric. 
    <span class="highlight">
    No late submissions will be accepted for the final submission.
    </span>

    <h2>Course Submissions</h2>

    All submissions must be your own, creative, unique work. 
    You may be asked to explain your work during class, in discussions, 
    or in a recorded submission.

    <h2>Course Grading</h2>

    Grades will generally be posted within 2-7 days of the due date. 
    If you wish to petition for additional points, please wait 24 hours. 
    Petitions must be emailed, 
    and must include the specific changes you are requesting, 
    along with your reasoning on why the higher score is warranted. 
    Challenges must be raised within seven days of the grade being posted; 
    after seven days, grades are considered final.

    <h2>Course Access Ends - Save Your Content</h2>

    The course site will not be available after the end of the semester.
    Save the syllabus and any materials you wish to access after the course,
    you may need to submit this to a potential employer 
    or another university in the future. 
    We do not provide materials after completion of the course.
