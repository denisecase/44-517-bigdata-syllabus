    <h2>Course Description </h2>
    An introduction to the design of data-intensive, reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.
    Includes an introduction to current and relevant tools, technologies, design principles, and frameworks.
    This may include concepts such as parallel programming, distributed computing, distributed file systems, MapReduce,
    regular expressions, and the ingesting and processing of data at-rest and data in motion.
    Tools used may include Hadoop, HDFS, Pig, Hive, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Mahout, MLlib, etc.

    <h2>Course Rationale</h2>
    This course involves an overview the design and implementation of data intensive systems covering common approaches
    to processing
    big data at rest and data in motion.

    Professional email practices are required.
    <ol>
      <li class="highlight ">Email must include course number and section (e.g.,
        <strong>44-517-01</strong>) in the subject line. </li>
      <li>Email should be professional, politely written, and use proper grammar, capitalization, and spelling. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Course Conduct Guidelines </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Students will behave in a professional manner in all course interactions.</li>
      <li> Devices including cell phones, ear phones, gadgets, and other items should be silent and put away during
        class.</li>
      <li> Unauthorized use of devices during class may result in reduction in scores.</li>
      <li>Be ready to work when the class is scheduled to begin.</li>
      <li>Be polite and respective to other people in the class. Do not interrupt someone during a class discussion,
        and respect

      <li>Failing to acknowledge assistance including internet photos, clipart, slide content, course files, shared
        solutions,
        etc. can be expected to result in a 0 on the assignment, a one-half letter grade reduction, a 0 in the course,
        and/or
        a failing the course with an academic integrity violation. </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Standard University -->

    <h2>Late Work Policy </h2>
    Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. Late work is not accepted and may result in a 0 for the
    assignment.
    If you must miss an activity or a deadline, contact the instructor in advance.

    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    All submissions must be unique and creative. All submissions must be your own, creative, unique work. Students may
    be asked
    to explain their work during class, in discussions, or in a recorded submission.

    <h2> Grade of Incomplete (I)</h2>
    Following Northwest Missouri State University policy, incomplete grades may only be given in extreme circumstances,
    such
    as illness, death in a student 's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's control, and the
    student
    was unable to complete a significant portion of the course work.

    <h2>Attendance </h2>
    Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course syllabi for each course. This course has
    many in-class
    activities, most of which have points and may not be announced in advance. Students arriving late or missing
    activities
    due to unexcused absences may not be able to make up work and may earn zero points for the activity. It is the
    responsibility
    of the student to promptly notify their instructor when unable to attend class. Please refer to the university
    policy
    on attendance at
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf">https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf</a>

    <h2>Excused Absences </h2>
    Excused absences include attendance at a university sponsored event (documented with an excuse signed by the
    university sponsor
    prior to the event) or by circumstances considered extenuating by the course instructor. A student may make up
    class
    work without penalty for excused absences.

    <h2>Final Exams</h2>
    If an emergency occurs that prevents the administration of a course scheduled final examination, the final course
    grades
    will be calculated based on the work in the course completed to that point in time and the faculty member’s
    considered
    judgment. Final exams will not be rescheduled, and a grade of “I” will not be given as a result of an institutional
    cancellation
    of a final examination.

    <h2>Administrative Drop </h2>
    An instructor may request the Office of the Registrar delete a student from a course roster if the student has not
    met the
    prerequisite for the course as stated in the catalog, or as a result of non-attendance in the course.

    <h2>Course Access</h2>
    Course content is provided via Canvas and Northwest Online. Access to Northwest Online is at
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/">https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/</a>.

    <h2>University Communications </h2>
    Students are expected to use their Northwest student email account for any electronic correspondence within the
    university.
    Students are also strongly advised to check their email and CatPAWS accounts on a regular basis.

    <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
    The students, faculty, and staff at Northwest endeavor to sustain an environment that values honesty in academic
    work, that
    acknowledges the authorized aid provided by and intellectual contributions of others, and that enables equitable
    student
    evaluation. Please refer to Northwest Missouri State University’s Academic Integrity Policy at
